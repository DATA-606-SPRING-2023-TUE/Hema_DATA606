 # Increase in Patients Wait Time  for Doctors Appointment
  
   I have choosen this project to find answer/ solution for the problem which i have personally faced. It is taking approximately 1 month of time to get doctors appointment espically for a dermatologist. In this 1 month of time the porblem may become more serious, means we are taking treatment after its severity increases. This leads to heavy dose of medicine. 
   
   Why can we get treated when it is in early stage? 
   Why it's taking 1 month of time for a common man to get doctors appopintment?
   Do we have shortage of Doctors in USA or patients are more vunerable to skin problems ?.
   Is their any economy related effect?
   These all are the questions for which i want to find answers
   
   Finding the data is a very though job here because Doctors data and Patients data a very confindetial. Here i need to have two different datasets and have to combine them.
   
   1. Doctors Dataset: doctors name, clinical name, primary specialization , secondary specialization, city, state, gender,age, working-hospital names, availability-date, time.
   2. Patient's Dataset: patient name, age, gender, patient address, city, state, problem, severity, family history, scheduled date, appointment date.
